# WADLoader

This is repository based on the code written by user Risto Paasivirta over at doomworld.
Here is a link to the forum post about this project: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/98682-doomloader-for-unity/
I have modified this project slightly in order to get it running on a newer version of unity, and to increase the readability of some of the code.
I may continue to make modifications, but my current goal is to use this project as a guide to doing the same thing in Unreal Engine 4.
